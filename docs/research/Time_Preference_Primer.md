# Time-Preference: A First Principles Primer

This document explains what it means to "sell time-preference" - starting from everyday intuition and building toward precise financial terminology and traditional finance analogies.

---

## Part I: Intuition

### The Bird in the Hand

Consider a simple choice:

> **Option A:** Receive $100 today
> **Option B:** Receive $100 one year from now

Most people choose Option A. Why? Three reasons:

1. **Uncertainty** - You might not be around in a year. The person promising might not be around. The world might change.
2. **Opportunity** - With $100 today, you could invest it, spend it, or use it to create more value.
3. **Impatience** - Humans are wired to prefer immediate gratification. We discount the future.

This preference for the present over the future is called **time-preference**.

### Making the Choice Interesting

Now consider:

> **Option A:** Receive $100 today
> **Option B:** Receive $110 one year from now

Some people now choose Option B. The extra $10 compensates them for waiting.

The question becomes: **How much extra do you need to wait?**

- If you'd wait for $105, your time-preference is "low" (patient)
- If you need $150 to wait, your time-preference is "high" (impatient)

This "how much extra" is the **price** of time-preference. It's what you charge others for borrowing your patience.

---

## Part II: The Economic Foundation

### Time-Preference as a Market

Every person has a different time-preference. Some are patient; some are impatient. This creates a market.

**Impatient people** (high time-preference):
- Want money NOW
- Willing to pay a premium for immediate access
- Borrowers, consumers, spenders

**Patient people** (low time-preference):
- Can wait for money LATER
- Demand compensation for waiting
- Lenders, savers, investors

When these groups meet, they trade. The impatient pay the patient for the privilege of accessing capital today. This payment has a name: **interest**.

### Interest: The Price of Time

Interest is not mysterious. It is simply the market-clearing price of time-preference.

```
Interest Rate = Compensation demanded by patient people
              = Premium paid by impatient people
              = The "exchange rate" between present and future dollars
```

At 5% annual interest:
- $100 today = $105 one year from now (to a patient person)
- $105 one year from now = $100 today (to an impatient person)

The interest rate makes these equivalent. It's the conversion factor between present value and future value.

---

## Part III: Present Value — The Core Equation

### Discounting the Future

If $100 today equals $105 in one year (at 5% interest), then logically:

$$\text{Present Value} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1 + r)}$$

Where `r` is the interest rate (discount rate).

**Example:**
- Future Value: $105
- Discount Rate: 5%
- Present Value: $105 ÷ 1.05 = $100

This is called **discounting**. We're converting future money into present-equivalent money.

### The Discount Rate IS Time-Preference

The discount rate used in present value calculations is a direct expression of time-preference:

| Discount Rate | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| 0% | No time-preference (future = present) |
| 5% | Moderate time-preference |
| 15% | High time-preference |
| 50% | Extreme time-preference (very impatient) |

A higher discount rate means the future is worth less to you today. You're more impatient.

---

## Part IV: Bonds — Time-Preference Made Tradeable

### What Is a Bond?

A bond is a financial instrument that makes time-preference explicit and tradeable.

**Zero-coupon bond example:**
- Face value: $100 (paid at maturity)
- Maturity: 3 years
- Price today: $86.38
- Implied yield: 5% annually

When you buy this bond for $86.38, you are:
1. Giving up $86.38 of present consumption
2. Receiving a promise of $100 in 3 years
3. Earning $13.62 for your patience

### What Does "Selling Time-Preference" Actually Mean?

Let's be precise about what just happened in that bond example.

You had $86.38 in your pocket. You could have spent it today — on anything. A nice dinner, a new gadget, an investment in something else. That money was *yours*, available *right now*.

Instead, you chose to give it away. You handed $86.38 to someone else, and in return, you received a piece of paper that says: "I promise to pay you $100 in three years."

**You traded present money for future money.**

The $13.62 difference ($100 - $86.38) is not a gift. It's not charity. It's **payment**. It's what the borrower paid you for the privilege of using your money for three years.

Think of it this way:
- You *sold* three years of your life's access to that money
- The buyer *purchased* three years of access to that money
- The price of that access was $13.62

That's what "selling time-preference" means. You're selling your right to use money *now* in exchange for getting more money *later*.

### The Two Sides of Every Bond

Every bond transaction has two people with opposite needs. Understanding who they are makes the whole concept click.

#### The Bond Issuer (The Borrower)

This is typically a company or government that needs money today.

**Their situation:**
- They have a project, a bill, or an opportunity that requires cash *immediately*
- They don't have the cash on hand
- They're willing to pay extra to get money now rather than waiting

**Their time-preference:** HIGH. They value present money much more than future money. They're impatient — not because they're irresponsible, but because they have an immediate use for the capital.

**What they're doing:** They're *buying* time-preference from you. They're paying a premium ($13.62 in our example) to access your capital today.

**In plain terms:** "I need $86.38 right now. I'm willing to promise you $100 in three years to get it. That extra $13.62 is the cost I'm willing to pay for immediacy."

#### The Bond Buyer (The Lender)

This is you — or any investor with savings they don't need immediately.

**Their situation:**
- They have cash sitting around
- They don't have an immediate use for it
- They're willing to wait for a larger payoff

**Their time-preference:** LOW. They value present money and future money more similarly. They're patient — they can afford to wait because they don't have pressing needs for the capital.

**What they're doing:** They're *selling* time-preference. They're accepting a smaller amount today in exchange for a larger amount later.

**In plain terms:** "I don't need this $86.38 right now. I'll let you use it for three years. In exchange, you'll pay me back $100. That extra $13.62 is my reward for being patient."

### The Bond Market: A Marketplace for Patience

Here's the insight that changes how you see financial markets:

**The bond market is not primarily about debt. It's about time.**

Every bond transaction is a trade between:
- Someone who values *now* more than *later* (the borrower)
- Someone who values *now* and *later* more equally (the lender)

The interest rate is simply the price at which these two types of people agree to trade.

If you've ever wondered why bonds exist, why interest rates matter, or what the "cost of capital" means — this is it. It's all about transferring the burden of waiting from impatient parties to patient parties, at an agreed-upon price.

### Yield: The Price Tag on Patience

"Yield" sounds technical, but it's just the answer to a simple question:

**"How much am I getting paid to wait?"**

In our example:
- You paid $86.38
- You'll receive $100 in 3 years
- Your yield is approximately 5% per year

That 5% is the market's current price for patience. It's what lenders demand — and borrowers accept — for the exchange of present money for future money.

#### Why Yields Change

Yields aren't fixed. They fluctuate every day based on how many patient vs. impatient people are in the market.

**Scenario A: High Yields (Patience is Expensive)**

Imagine a world where:
- Many companies desperately need cash (lots of impatient borrowers)
- Few people have savings to lend (few patient lenders)

What happens? Borrowers compete for scarce capital. They have to offer higher and higher returns to attract lenders. Yields rise.

*Translation: "Patience is scarce, so it commands a high price."*

**Scenario B: Low Yields (Patience is Cheap)**

Now imagine the opposite:
- Few companies need to borrow (few impatient borrowers)
- Many people have cash sitting idle (lots of patient lenders)

What happens? Lenders compete to find anyone who will take their money. They accept lower and lower returns. Yields fall.

*Translation: "Patience is abundant, so it's cheap."*

### Decoding the Federal Reserve

When you hear on the news:

> "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25%"

Here's how to translate that into time-preference language:

> "The price of patience just increased. Borrowers will now have to pay more to access capital. Lenders will now earn more for waiting."

And when the Fed lowers rates:

> "The price of patience just decreased. Borrowing is cheaper. Lending earns less."

The Fed isn't doing anything mystical. It's adjusting the baseline price at which patience trades in the economy. Everything else — mortgage rates, car loans, corporate bonds, savings account yields — ripples out from that baseline.

### Summary: The Bond Section in Plain Terms

| Role | Time-Preference | What They Do | What They Get |
|------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Borrower** | High (impatient) | Pays premium for money now | Immediate capital |
| **Lender** | Low (patient) | Accepts money later | Premium payment (yield) |

The **yield** is the price.
The **bond** is the contract.
The **market** is where patient and impatient people find each other.

That's all it is. Everything else is detail.

## Part V: Options — Time as a Decaying Asset

### The Option Premium

Options introduce another dimension of time-preference: the value of optionality over time.

An option gives you the **right, but not obligation** to do something. That flexibility has value. And that value decays as time passes.

**Call option example:**
- Stock price: $100
- Strike price: $100 (at-the-money)
- Expiration: 1 year
- Option price: $10

The $10 premium consists of:
- **Intrinsic value:** $0 (stock is at strike price)
- **Time value:** $10 (pure optionality value)

### Theta: The Decay of Time Value

As expiration approaches, time value decays. This decay is called **theta**.

```
Day 0:   Option worth $10.00 (365 days of optionality)
Day 180: Option worth $7.07  (182 days of optionality)
Day 300: Option worth $4.16  (65 days of optionality)
Day 364: Option worth $0.80  (1 day of optionality)
Day 365: Option worth $0.00  (expired, only intrinsic remains)
```

Time value doesn't disappear — it transfers. When you **sell an option**, you capture that time value. You're selling someone else's optionality, which is another form of selling time-preference.

### The Option Seller's Position

When you sell (write) an option:
- You receive the premium upfront (immediate cash)
- You accept an obligation that may or may not be exercised
- You profit if time passes without adverse movement

**The option seller is selling time-preference to the option buyer.**

The buyer pays for the luxury of waiting to decide. The seller collects that payment in exchange for bearing uncertainty.

---

## Part VI: Black-Scholes — Formalizing Time Value

### The Model

The Black-Scholes model prices options by decomposing value into components, with time being explicit:

$$C = S_0 N(d_1) - Ke^{-rT} N(d_2)$$

Where:
- `C` = Call option price
- `S₀` = Current stock price
- `K` = Strike price
- `r` = Risk-free rate
- `T` = **Time to expiration** (the critical variable)
- `N(d)` = Cumulative normal distribution

The term `e^{-rT}` is the **discount factor** — it converts the strike price from future value to present value. This is time-preference embedded directly in the formula.

### Time's Effect on Option Value

Holding all else constant, more time = more option value:

| Time to Expiration | At-the-Money Option Value |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 year | $10.00 |
| 6 months | $7.07 |
| 3 months | $5.00 |
| 1 month | $2.89 |
| 1 week | $1.39 |
| 1 day | $0.29 |

The relationship follows √T (square root of time), which is why theta accelerates near expiration.

### What Black-Scholes Teaches Us

1. **Time has quantifiable value** — it can be priced precisely
2. **Time value decays predictably** — theta is calculable
3. **Time-preference is tradeable** — options markets exist to trade it
4. **Longer duration = more valuable** — all else equal

## Transition: From Traditional Finance to the Protocol

Parts I-VI established how time-preference operates in traditional markets:
- **Bonds:** Patient lenders earn yield from impatient borrowers
- **Options:** Time value decays predictably toward expiration

The BTCNFT protocol creates a time-preference market with **distinct structural dynamics** from traditional bonds. Rather than a borrower-lender relationship, vBTC markets operate as a **derivative claim market** where vault holders sell structured claims against locked collateral. The following sections explore how the protocol differs from these traditional instruments — particularly in who pays the premium and who receives it.

---

## Part VII: The BTCNFT Protocol — A Time-Preference Market

### The Protocol's Core Mechanism

The BTCNFT protocol creates a market for time-preference denominated in Bitcoin.

**The Vault Holder's Position:**
- Deposits 1.0 BTC
- Vests for 1129 days (~3.09 years)
- After vesting, can withdraw 1% monthly forever (asymptotic)
- Can "separate" to receive vBTC (fungible claim on collateral)

**The Key Decision:**
After vesting, the holder has a choice:
1. **Hold** — withdraw 1% monthly, extracting value over decades
2. **Separate and sell** — create vBTC, sell it for immediate BTC at a discount

This choice is purely about time-preference — but the dynamics are inverted from traditional bonds.

### Traditional Finance Analogies: Vault vs. vBTC

To understand the protocol, map each component to familiar instruments.

#### The Vault: A Deferred Perpetuity

The vault behaves like a **deferred perpetuity** — a stream of payments that begins after a lockup period:

| Vault Characteristic | Traditional Analog |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 BTC deposit | Principal investment |
| 1129-day vesting | Lockup / deferral period |
| 1% monthly withdrawals (post-vest) | Perpetual declining coupon stream |
| Asymptotic decay (never reaches zero) | Amortizing principal with infinite tail |

The vault is an income-producing instrument with perpetual, declining payments.

#### vBTC: A Subordinated Residual Claim

After separation, the original vault owner retains withdrawal rights.

This means:
- The vault owner can sell vBTC AND continue receiving 1% monthly withdrawals
- The vBTC buyer holds a claim on collateral that is actively being drained
- Every month, the underlying collateral shrinks by 1% (going to the original owner)

vBTC behaves like a **subordinated residual claim**:

| vBTC Characteristic | Traditional Analog |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Claim on collateral after withdrawals | Junior tranche / equity residual |
| Value decreases as withdrawals occur | Subordinated to senior income stream |
| Must be actively managed or redeemed | Requires active position management |
| Trades at discount to underlying | Reflects subordination + decay risk |

In corporate finance terms: The vault owner holds the "senior" claim (perpetual income stream). The vBTC buyer holds the "junior" claim (whatever remains after senior payments).

#### Protocol Actions Mapped to Traditional Finance

| Protocol Action | Closest Analogy | Key Difference |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Minting a vault | Issuing a bond to yourself | You're both issuer and holder |
| Vesting period | Bond lockup / restriction | Non-negotiable, protocol-enforced |
| Separating to vBTC | Stripping a bond | Seller retains the "coupon" stream |
| Selling vBTC at discount | Selling equity in a depleting asset | Dynamics inverted from bonds |
| vBTC buyer | Buyer of a subordinated claim | Paying for time-compression, not earning yield |
| vBTC discount | Cost of immediacy | Premium paid by buyer, not earned |
| Withdrawal rate (1% monthly) | Senior claim / preferred dividend | Goes to original owner, not vBTC holder |

**Critical distinction:** In bond markets, the buyer earns the discount as yield. In vBTC markets, the buyer pays the discount as the cost of skipping the vest.

#### Alternative Mental Model: Covered Call Writer

The vault holder's position after separation resembles a **covered call writer**:

| Covered Call | Vault + vBTC Sale |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Own underlying stock | Own locked BTC collateral |
| Sell call option | Sell vBTC claim |
| Receive premium upfront | Receive discounted BTC (0.85) |
| Retain dividends | Retain 1% monthly withdrawals |
| Cap upside at strike | Cap claim at remaining collateral |

This analogy clarifies why the vault holder benefits from stability and decay, while the vBTC buyer needs active management to extract value.

#### What Happens When vBTC Is Sold

When the vault owner sells vBTC on Curve for 0.85 BTC:
- They receive 0.85 BTC immediately
- They retain perpetual 1% monthly withdrawals on the original 1.0 BTC
- The vBTC buyer receives the subordinated residual claim

The vault owner extracts value twice: once from the vBTC sale, perpetually from withdrawals.

### The Discount: What Is It Actually Pricing?

The 15% discount is not simple time-preference compensation. It prices multiple factors:

```
vBTC Price = 0.85 BTC

The discount reflects:
├─ Structural decay (withdrawals drain the underlying)
├─ Redemption complexity (buyer must actively manage position)
├─ Protocol risk (smart contract exposure)
├─ Liquidity risk (secondary market depth)
└─ Time-compression premium (buyer avoids 3-year vest)
```

The discount is **not** the buyer's reward for patience. It's the **price the buyer pays** for immediate protocol exposure without vesting.

### Who Buys vBTC? (Who Has Higher Time-Preference?)

This is the inversion from traditional bonds:

**The vBTC buyer has HIGH time-preference.**

Why? Because they want BTC-protocol exposure NOW. They don't want to:
- Deposit their own BTC
- Wait 3+ years for vesting to complete
- Lock up capital during the vesting period

They're impatient. They're paying for immediacy.

**The vBTC seller has LOW time-preference (demonstrated patience).**

They already waited 3+ years. They've proven their patience. Now they're monetizing it:
- Immediate capital from vBTC sale
- Ongoing withdrawals from their vault
- Maximum extraction from their original position

### The Time-Preference Inversion

Traditional bonds:
| Role | Time-Preference | What They Do |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Borrower/Issuer | HIGH | Pays premium for money now |
| Lender/Buyer | LOW | Gets paid to wait |

vBTC market:
| Role | Time-Preference | What They Do |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| vBTC Seller | LOW (proven patience) | Monetizes 3+ years of demonstrated patience |
| vBTC Buyer | HIGH (wants exposure now) | Pays discount to skip the 3-year vest |

**The discount flows in the opposite direction from bonds.**

In bonds, the buyer earns the discount (compensation for waiting).
In vBTC, the buyer pays the discount (cost of skipping the wait).

### Why Would Anyone Buy vBTC?

Given the structural decay and inverted dynamics, why does demand exist?

**1. Time-Compression Value**

Minting your own vault requires:
- Locking 1.0 BTC for 3+ years
- Opportunity cost during vesting
- Patience you may not have

Buying vBTC gives you:
- Immediate BTC-protocol exposure
- No lockup (you can resell)
- Access to DeFi integrations today

For someone with high time-preference, the 15% discount is worth paying.

**2. Specific Utility Functions**

- **Arbitrageurs:** If the discount widens beyond fair value, they buy vBTC and profit on convergence
- **LPs:** They provide liquidity in Curve pools and earn trading fees; the discount is their "inventory cost"
- **Short-term traders:** Capture discount movements without holding through significant decay

**3. Speculative Positioning**

- Bet on discount compression (protocol adoption → tighter spreads)
- Bet on BTC appreciation (leveraged through discounted exposure)
- Yield farming incentives (CRV rewards on Curve pools)

### The Complete Picture

```
VAULT OWNER'S POSITION (after separation + sale):
├─ Received: 0.85 BTC immediately (from vBTC sale)
├─ Retains: 1% monthly withdrawals forever
├─ Total extraction: 0.85 + Σ(decaying withdrawals) > 1.0 BTC over time
└─ Net position: PROFITABLE (monetized patience + ongoing income)

vBTC BUYER'S POSITION:
├─ Paid: 0.85 BTC
├─ Received: Claim on collateral minus all withdrawals
├─ Value trajectory: Decaying (underlying shrinks monthly)
├─ Must: Actively manage, redeem, or resell to capture value
└─ Net position: Profitable only if utility > decay cost
```

The vBTC buyer is not a "patient investor earning yield." They're an **active participant paying for time-compression** who must deploy their position strategically to overcome structural decay.

---

## Part VIII: Mathematical Framework

### Formalizing the Two Claims

After separation, the vault's collateral supports two distinct claims. Each requires separate mathematical treatment.

**Variables:**
- `V₀` = Initial vault collateral (1.0 BTC)
- `w` = Monthly withdrawal rate (0.01 = 1%)
- `t` = Months since vesting completed
- `r` = Market discount rate for time-preference

### The Senior Claim: Vault Owner's Withdrawal Stream

The vault owner retains the right to perpetual withdrawals. This is the **senior claim**.

**Remaining collateral at month t:**
$$V(t) = V_0 \cdot (1-w)^t$$

**Withdrawal at month t:**
$$W(t) = V(t) \cdot w = V_0 \cdot w \cdot (1-w)^t$$

**Present value of all future withdrawals (from the vault owner's perspective):**

**Discrete Formula (Exact):**
$$PV_{senior} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} V_0 \cdot w \cdot (1-w)^n \cdot (1+r_{monthly})^{-n}$$

Where $r_{monthly} = (1+r_{annual})^{1/12} - 1$

**Continuous Approximation:**
$$PV_{senior} \approx \frac{V_0 \cdot w}{r + w}$$

The continuous approximation introduces ~3-5% error at typical discount rates (5-10%). For precision, use the discrete summation or the closed-form:

$$PV_{senior} = \frac{V_0 \cdot w}{1 - \frac{(1-w)}{(1+r_{monthly})}}$$

At 12% annual withdrawal rate (w ≈ 0.01 monthly) and 5% discount rate:
$$PV_{senior} = \frac{1.0 \times 0.12}{0.05 + 0.12} = 0.706 \text{ BTC}$$

The vault owner's withdrawal stream is worth ~70% of the initial collateral in present value terms.

### The Junior Claim: vBTC Holder's Residual

The vBTC holder receives whatever remains after all withdrawals. This is the **junior/subordinated claim**.

**Residual collateral (what vBTC holder can eventually claim):**
$$V_{residual}(t) = V_0 \cdot (1-w)^t$$

As t → ∞, this approaches zero (Zeno's paradox — asymptotic but never reaching zero).

**Present value of the residual claim:**

The vBTC holder's claim is subordinated to the withdrawal stream. Their value is:
$$PV_{junior} = V_0 - PV_{senior}$$

Using the example above:
$$PV_{junior} = 1.0 - 0.706 = 0.294 \text{ BTC}$$

**The market price of vBTC (0.85 BTC) exceeds this theoretical junior value (0.294 BTC).**

This gap reflects:
- Time-compression premium (buyers pay to skip 3-year vest)
- Speculative value (discount narrowing, BTC appreciation bets)
- Utility value (LP provision, arbitrage, speculation)

### Why vBTC Trades Above Theoretical Residual Value

If vBTC were purely a claim on residual collateral, it would trade near 0.29 BTC. Instead, it trades at 0.85 BTC.

**Observed Market Price Decomposition (Illustrative)**

The gap between theoretical residual value (0.29 BTC) and market price (0.85 BTC) reflects market participants' aggregate valuation of:

| Component | Driver | Observable? |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Theoretical residual | PV of collateral after withdrawals | Yes (calculable) |
| Vesting bypass value | Cost to mint own vault and wait 3 years | Yes (opportunity cost) |
| Liquidity premium | Depth of Curve pool, bid-ask spread | Yes (market data) |
| Speculation premium | BTC price expectations, protocol adoption | No (residual) |

**Important:** The "time-compression premium" is not independently derived—it is the residual after subtracting calculable components. This decomposition is illustrative, not predictive.

vBTC buyers pay more than the residual value because they're purchasing immediate protocol access, not just the mathematical residual.

### The Discount: A Multi-Factor Price

The 15% discount (1.0 BTC underlying → 0.85 BTC price) reflects:

```
Discount components:
├─ Subordination risk (senior claim drains collateral)
├─ Redemption complexity (active management required)
├─ Protocol risk (smart contract exposure)
├─ Liquidity risk (secondary market depth)
└─ Offset by: time-compression value (skip 3-year vest)
```

The discount is the net price after these factors balance.

### Value Trajectories Over Time

Unlike options (where time value decays to zero at expiration), vBTC has no fixed expiration. Both claims evolve perpetually:

**Vault owner's position:**
| Time | Cumulative Withdrawn | Remaining Collateral |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0 years | 0 BTC | 1.000 BTC |
| 5 years | 0.453 BTC | 0.547 BTC |
| 10 years | 0.697 BTC | 0.303 BTC |
| 20 years | 0.908 BTC | 0.092 BTC |
| 50 years | 0.995 BTC | 0.005 BTC |

**vBTC holder's claim (on remaining collateral):**

The vBTC holder's claim shrinks in absolute terms as the vault owner withdraws. There is no "convergence to intrinsic value" as in options — the underlying itself is depleting.

This is why vBTC requires active management: hold too long, and the residual erodes toward zero.

## Part VIII-A: Sensitivity Analysis

### Discount Rate Impact on Valuations

The choice of discount rate fundamentally affects PV calculations. The following tables show sensitivity across plausible rate ranges.

#### Senior Claim (Vault Owner's Withdrawals)

| Annual Discount Rate | Monthly Rate | PV_senior | % of Collateral |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 3% | 0.247% | 0.800 BTC | 80.0% |
| 5% | 0.407% | 0.706 BTC | 70.6% |
| 8% | 0.643% | 0.600 BTC | 60.0% |
| 10% | 0.797% | 0.545 BTC | 54.5% |
| 12% | 0.949% | 0.500 BTC | 50.0% |
| 15% | 1.171% | 0.444 BTC | 44.4% |

**Formula:** $PV_{senior} = \frac{w}{w + r_{monthly}}$ (continuous approximation)

#### Junior Claim (vBTC Theoretical Residual)

| Annual Discount Rate | PV_junior (Theoretical) | Market Price (0.85) | Gap |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| 3% | 0.200 BTC | 0.85 BTC | +0.65 |
| 5% | 0.294 BTC | 0.85 BTC | +0.56 |
| 8% | 0.400 BTC | 0.85 BTC | +0.45 |
| 10% | 0.455 BTC | 0.85 BTC | +0.40 |
| 12% | 0.500 BTC | 0.85 BTC | +0.35 |
| 15% | 0.556 BTC | 0.85 BTC | +0.29 |

**Insight:** At higher discount rates, the "unexplained premium" shrinks. If buyers use ~15% discount rate (plausible for crypto-native capital), the gap is only 0.29 BTC vs. 0.56 BTC at 5%.

### Withdrawal Rate Sensitivity

What if the protocol used different withdrawal rates?

| Monthly Withdrawal | Annual Equivalent | PV_senior (5% disc) | PV_junior | Break-even CAGR |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0.5% | 6% | 0.551 BTC | 0.449 BTC | 6% |
| 1.0% | 12% | 0.706 BTC | 0.294 BTC | 12% |
| 1.5% | 18% | 0.782 BTC | 0.218 BTC | 18% |
| 2.0% | 24% | 0.828 BTC | 0.172 BTC | 24% |

**Insight:** Higher withdrawal rates increase senior claim value but require higher BTC CAGR to maintain USD value of collateral.

### vBTC Market Discount Sensitivity

Impact of discount variations on Strategy 1 (Perpetual Roll):

| vBTC Discount | BTC Retained/Cycle | 50-Year Net BTC | Annualized Alpha |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 5% (tight) | 0.95 | 9.8 BTC | +4.7% |
| 10% (healthy) | 0.90 | 7.9 BTC | +4.2% |
| 15% (baseline) | 0.85 | 6.55 BTC | +3.9% |
| 20% (stressed) | 0.80 | 5.4 BTC | +3.4% |
| 30% (crisis) | 0.70 | 3.5 BTC | +2.5% |
| 50% (broken) | 0.50 | 1.5 BTC | +0.8% |

**Critical Threshold:** At ~65% discount, Strategy 1 equals HODL performance.

### Combined Sensitivity Matrix

**50-Year Net BTC (Strategy 1) by Discount Rate × vBTC Discount:**

|  | vBTC 10% | vBTC 15% | vBTC 20% | vBTC 30% |
|--|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **r = 3%** | 8.5 | 7.1 | 5.8 | 3.8 |
| **r = 5%** | 7.9 | 6.55 | 5.4 | 3.5 |
| **r = 8%** | 7.2 | 5.9 | 4.9 | 3.1 |
| **r = 12%** | 6.4 | 5.3 | 4.3 | 2.7 |

**Reading:** At 5% discount rate and 15% vBTC discount, expect 6.55x BTC over 50 years.

## Part IX: The Act of "Selling" Time-Preference

### What You're Actually Doing

When a vault holder separates and sells vBTC at a discount:

1. **You monetize demonstrated patience** — You waited 3+ years; now you're converting that patience into capital
2. **You retain the income stream** — Monthly withdrawals continue flowing to you
3. **You transfer the residual claim** — The buyer gets what remains after your withdrawals
4. **You double-extract value** — Immediate capital from sale + perpetual withdrawals from vault

This is not desperation selling. This is strategic monetization of a patient position.

### The Trade Is Not Zero-Sum

Both parties can benefit — but for inverted reasons compared to bonds:

**Seller benefits because:**
- They've already demonstrated low time-preference (3+ years of patience)
- They extract maximum value: immediate capital + ongoing withdrawals
- They've completed the hard part (vesting) and now harvest the rewards

**Buyer benefits if:**
- They have high time-preference (want BTC exposure NOW, not in 3 years)
- They have specific utility for vBTC (arbitrage, LP provision, speculation)
- The discount adequately compensates for structural decay
- Their use case extracts value faster than the decay erodes it

The discount is the **price of time-compression** — what impatient capital pays to skip the vesting queue.

## Part X: Implications and Insights

### Your Decision as a Vault Owner

After vesting, you've demonstrated patience. Now you choose how to monetize it:

| Your Situation | Decision | Outcome |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Need capital now | Separate and sell vBTC | Immediate 0.85 BTC + ongoing 1% monthly |
| No pressing need | Hold, withdraw over time | Maximum total extraction (but slower) |
| Want both | Partial sale | Balance of immediacy and ongoing income |

Note: Even the "need capital now" path isn't desperation — you're monetizing demonstrated patience while retaining income rights.

### The Discount Is Information

The vBTC market discount reveals the balance of urgency between buyers and sellers:

- **Wide discount (20%+):** Many impatient buyers demanding larger discounts, or excess vBTC supply. Buyers have negotiating power.
- **Tight discount (5%):** Strong buyer demand for vBTC, or scarce supply. Sellers can command better prices.
- **Volatile discount:** Uncertainty about protocol, BTC price, or DeFi ecosystem health.

The discount tracks how much impatient capital is willing to pay for time-compression.

### Duration as a Strategic Variable

The protocol lets you actively manage your time exposure:

| Position | Duration Stance | What You're Betting On |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Hold vault, withdraw slowly | Long duration | BTC appreciation over decades |
| Sell vBTC immediately | Short duration | Better use for capital elsewhere |
| Buy vBTC at discount | Absorbing duration | Discount narrowing or utility extraction |
| LP in Curve pool | Duration neutral | Trading fees regardless of direction |

This is analogous to bond portfolio management, where duration exposure is a core strategic decision.

## Summary: The Vocabulary of Time-Preference

| Term | Definition | Protocol Context |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Time-preference** | Preference for present over future | Your willingness to wait for BTC |
| **Discount rate** | The price of time-preference | The vBTC market discount |
| **Present value** | Future value adjusted for time-preference | What vBTC trades for today |
| **Monetizing patience** | Extracting value from demonstrated waiting | Selling vBTC after 3+ year vest |
| **Duration** | Sensitivity to time-preference changes | How long until full redemption |
| **Structural decay** | Perpetual reduction in underlying value | 1% monthly withdrawals to original owner |
| **Time-compression premium** | Cost paid to skip waiting | The discount paid by vBTC buyers |

---

## Conclusion

"Selling time-preference" in the BTCNFT protocol is **inverted** from traditional bond markets.

**In bonds:**
- Impatient borrowers pay patient lenders
- The lender earns the discount as yield
- Patience is rewarded with income

**In vBTC:**
- Patient vault owners (who already vested 3+ years) sell to impatient buyers
- The seller keeps both the sale proceeds AND the ongoing withdrawals
- The buyer pays the discount as the cost of immediate exposure
- Patience was already demonstrated; now it's being monetized

When you sell vBTC at a discount, you are:
1. Harvesting the value of 3+ years of demonstrated patience
2. Extracting immediate capital while retaining perpetual income
3. Transferring a decaying residual claim to someone who values immediacy

The discount is not a "loss." It is the **price impatient capital pays** to access the protocol without waiting. The seller has already done the waiting — now they profit from both sides.

**Patient capital monetizes. Impatient capital pays the premium.** The protocol creates a marketplace where demonstrated patience meets urgent demand — denominated in Bitcoin, governed by immutable contracts, and cleared by DeFi liquidity.

## Data Period Context

Historical analyses in this document reference the following data periods:

| Source | Period | Observations | Result |
|--------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Core protocol research | 2017-2025 | 2,930 daily | 100% positive 1129-day windows |
| Extended analysis | 2014-2025 | 4,115 daily | 99.7% positive (9 negative from early-adoption volatility) |

The 2017-2025 period represents mature BTC market behavior post-initial-speculation. The 2014-2017 period includes extreme early-adoption volatility in both directions. For detailed methodology, see [Quantitative Validation](../protocol/Quantitative_Validation.md).
