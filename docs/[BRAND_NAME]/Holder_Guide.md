- Coinbase → cbBTC

### Step 4: Redeem Your Badge

## Vault Stacking

### How It Works

Each Vault generates achievements over time. You can redeem achievements for additional Vaults:

```
Entry Badge + BTC → Vault #1
                      ↓
               Earn "First Month" Achievement
                      ↓
               First Month + BTC → Vault #2
                      ↓
               Earn more achievements...
```

### Available Achievements

| Achievement | Requirement | Enables |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| First Month | Hold 30 days | New Vault |
| Quarter Stack | Hold 91 days | New Vault |
| Half Year | Hold 182 days | New Vault |
| Annual | Hold 365 days | New Vault |
| Diamond Hands | Hold 730 days | New Vault |
| Hodler Supreme | Hold 1093 days | New Vault |

### Benefits of Stacking

- Multiple withdrawal streams post-vesting
- Each Vault generates its own achievements
- Compounding: more time = more achievements = more Vaults

## [BRAND_NAME] Specific FAQ

### Entry

**How do I get an Entry Badge?**
Complete the brand onboarding process. Details at [placeholder].

**Can I buy an Entry Badge?**
No. Entry Badges are soulbound (non-transferable). You must earn them through engagement.

**What if I already have an Entry Badge?**
Each Entry Badge can only be redeemed once. If you've redeemed yours, earn achievements to stack additional Vaults.

### Participation

**Why [BRAND_NAME] vs open minting?**
- Unique Treasure art for each badge type
- Community of aligned participants
- Brand-specific achievements and gamification

**Can I participate without a badge?**
No. [BRAND_NAME] uses badge-gated minting exclusively.

### Series

**What is a series?**
Series are themed collections of Treasures. Bitcoin Series is ongoing; future series may be limited edition.

**Can I choose which series to join?**
Yes, if you have an eligible badge for that series.
