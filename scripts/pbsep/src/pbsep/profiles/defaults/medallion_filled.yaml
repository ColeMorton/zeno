# Medallion Filled profile - adaptive threshold for filled surfaces
#
# Tuned for AI-generated luxury medallions with:
# - Polished gold and platinum surfaces
# - Pave diamonds and gemstones
# - Metallic reflections and studio lighting
# - Art Deco lettering and engravings
#
# Output style: Filled surfaces (preserves interior detail)
# Binarization: Adaptive Gaussian threshold
# Expected opacity: ~30-40% (more detail than outline mode)
